This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage. The app crashes silently without providing clear error messages in the console. The problem is caused by incorrectly managing the asynchronous operations of AsyncStorage, leading to attempts to access data before the promise resolves.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle AsyncStorage promises using `.then()` and `.catch()` to gracefully manage potential errors and prevent crashes.
